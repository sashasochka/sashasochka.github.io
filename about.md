I am a Software Developer working at Microsoft Corporation in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Originally from Kyiv, Ukraine, graduated from NTUU "KPI" university. 

In the past I had two internships at Microsoft in Redmond. At Microsoft I work on Digital Ink, which you might now from Windows 10 Ink Workspace and Surface Pen. I love technology, open-source and interesting global projects -- you can contact me if you have something interesting to tell or propose.

## Technologies I am best familiar with

* Windows: COM, WRL, Windows Runtime, powershell.
* Linux: bash; used to be a Linux guy for a long time.
* Git
* C++ (including new standards)
* Javascript, Node.js
* html5 & CSS3
* Java SE (not familiar with fancy frameworks).
* python

## Coursera

At my free time I like studying coursera courses (especially in the past when I had more time). These were the most interesting ones I took:

* Algorithms
* Programming Languages
* Functional Programming Principles in Scala
* Automaton theory
* Machine Learning
* and many more

## Hobbies

* Competitive programming (CodeForces, TopCoder)
* Learning new programming languages. I am well familiar with more than 10 languages, although, not practicing them regularly, I might not be able to write hello world with some of them, immediately.
* History, geography and politics
* Watching football (soccer) matches, boxing.
* Skiing, hiking, snowboarding (learning).
* Visiting new places - countries and cities.
