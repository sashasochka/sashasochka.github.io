I am a third year Software Engineering student at the
National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytechnic Institute" (or KPI, in short) located in Kyiv, Ukraine.

I have been fascinated by technology and especially programming since early high-school.

During this summer (2014) I'll be an intern at [Microsoft Corp](https://microsoft.com) for 12 weeks.
After two sets of the interviews with very friendly Microsoft developers and HR's who flew to Kyiv I received an offer
and will be a member of Operating System division.

My internship will be in Seattle city.
